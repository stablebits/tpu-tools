## Overview

`solana-transaction-bench` is a load-generation tool for Solana validators and clusters. It
generates transfer transactions, and sends them over QUIC to current and upcoming TPU leaders.

For testnet, the recommended workflow is to create payer accounts once with `write-accounts`, then
reuse them with `read-accounts-run`. For private or local clusters, `run` can create ephemeral payer
accounts and start the benchmark in one command.

### Usage Examples

#### Local Validator

Use `run` on a private or local cluster when it is acceptable to create fresh payer accounts for a
single benchmark run. This example funds `256` payer accounts, validates them, and sends transfer
transactions for `30` seconds using a staked QUIC connection. It assumes the local validator config
lives at `../solana/config`, with the faucet payer at `faucet.json` and the validator identity at
`bootstrap-validator/identity.json`. `pinned-leader-tracker` sends all transactions to the chosen
node.

```shell
args=(
  -ul
  --authority "$validator_config_dir/faucet.json"
  --validate-accounts
  run
  --num-payers 256
  --payer-account-balance 1SOL
  --duration 30
  --staked-identity-file "$validator_config_dir/bootstrap-validator/identity.json"
  --transfer-tx-cu-budget 600
  pinned-leader-tracker "127.0.0.1:8002"
)
solana-transaction-bench "${args[@]}"
```

#### Cluster with saved accounts

On public clusters such as testnet, it is more convinient to create payer accounts once and reuse
them across benchmark runs. This avoids repeatedly funding accounts and makes runs easier to
restart. Use enough payer accounts for the load you want to generate: `1024` is a reasonable
starting point for high-throughput tests.

```shell
create_accounts_args=(
  -u "$URL"
  --authority "$FUNDER_KEYPAIR"
  --validate-accounts
  write-accounts
  --accounts-file accounts.json
  --num-payers 1024
  --payer-account-balance 1SOL
)
solana-transaction-bench "${create_accounts_args[@]}"
```

After `accounts.json` is created, use `read-accounts-run` to start sending transactions. A high
`--lamports-to-transfer` value gives the generator enough unique transfer amounts to avoid duplicate
transactions within generated batches. Here we use `ws-leader-tracker` to keep track of leaders
using websocket.

```shell
run_args=(
  -u "$URL"
  --authority "$FUNDER_KEYPAIR"
  read-accounts-run
  --accounts-file accounts.json
  --duration 30
  --staked-identity-file "$VALIDATOR_IDENTITY"
  --num-max-open-connections 16
  --workers-pull-size 8
  --send-fanout 1
  --transfer-tx-cu-budget 350
  --lamports-to-transfer 8096
  --num-send-instructions-per-tx 1
  ws-leader-tracker
)
solana-transaction-bench "${run_args[@]}"
```

#### Multiple Staked Identities

Pass `--staked-identity-file` more than once to spawn multiple
`tpu-client-next` instances. Repeat the same keypair to open multiple clients
under one identity, or pass different keypairs when you want to use distinct
stake allocations.

```shell
args=(
  -u "$URL"
  read-accounts-run
  --accounts-file accounts.json
  --duration 30
  --staked-identity-file ./identity-a.json
  --staked-identity-file ./identity-b.json
  --staked-identity-file ./identity-c.json
  --send-fanout 1
  ws-leader-tracker
)
solana-transaction-bench "${args[@]}"
```

#### Target TPS

Use `--target-tps` to pace transaction generation instead of sending as fast as
the generator and connection workers allow. When `--target-tps` is set and
`--tx-batch-size` is not set, the tool chooses a batch size for roughly 10
batches per second and adjusts the generator worker count for the requested
rate.

```shell
args=(
  -u "$URL"
  read-accounts-run
  --accounts-file accounts.json
  --duration 30
  --target-tps 5000
  --transfer-tx-cu-budget 600
  --send-fanout 2
  ws-leader-tracker
)
solana-transaction-bench "${args[@]}"
```

#### Priority Fees

Use `--compute-unit-price` to set a fixed base compute-unit price in microlamports. To vary the
price per transaction, set `--random-compute-unit-price-max`: by default each transaction gets an
additional random value in `0..=N` on top of the base. Add `--priority-fee-schedule-period-ms` to
switch from random selection to a deterministic sawtooth schedule that ramps the additional value
from `0` to max over the period, then resets and repeats. When priority-fee mode is enabled and
`--compute-unit-price` is omitted, the base defaults to `1`. `--priority-fee-schedule-period-ms`
requires a positive `--random-compute-unit-price-max`; a `1` millisecond period is degenerate and
does not produce a meaningful ramp.

```shell
args=(
  -u "$URL"
  read-accounts-run
  --accounts-file accounts.json
  --duration 30
  --target-tps 5000
  --compute-unit-price 1000
  --random-compute-unit-price-max 5000
  --priority-fee-schedule-period-ms 2000
  --transfer-tx-cu-budget 600
  --send-fanout 2
  ws-leader-tracker
)
solana-transaction-bench "${args[@]}"
```

When priority-fee mode is active, the tool emits the `transaction-bench-priority-fees` datapoint
with `total_priority_fees`, the sum of selected compute-unit prices, and `tx_count` for the
reporting interval.

#### Large Transactions

Increase transaction size by adding more transfer instructions per transaction or by wrapping
transfers with the SPL instruction padding program. When instruction padding is enabled, the padding
program must exist on the target cluster; pass `--instruction-padding-program-id` if you are using a
custom deployment. This example derives the local program id from
`../solana/tmp/spl_instruction_padding.json`; set `INSTRUCTION_PADDING_PROGRAM_ID` or
`INSTRUCTION_PADDING_KEYPAIR` to use a different deployment. The tool checks that program account
before sending.

Note: multiple transfer instructions per transaction are supported without Transaction V1 by setting
`--num-send-instructions-per-tx`. The `--use-txv1` flag in this example only switches generated
transactions to Transaction V1 format. Transaction V1 is available only when the target Agave
cluster supports it and the `enable_tx_v1` feature is activated, so verify cluster support before
using `--use-txv1` on external clusters.

```shell
args=(
  -u "$URL"
  read-accounts-run
  --accounts-file accounts.json
  --duration 30
  --num-send-instructions-per-tx 4
  --transfer-tx-cu-budget 4000
  --instruction-padding-data-size 512
  --instruction-padding-program-id "$instruction_padding_program_id"
  --use-txv1
  --send-fanout 2
  ws-leader-tracker
)
solana-transaction-bench "${args[@]}"
```

cd instruction-padding
cargo build-sbf
solana -u "$URL" program deploy spl_instruction_padding.so --program-id spl_instruction_padding.json -k config/faucet.json
```

#### Transaction Conflicts

Use `--tx-batch-size` with `--num-conflict-groups` to intentionally reuse destination accounts
within each generated batch. Lower conflict group counts create more account conflicts.
`--num-conflict-groups` must be no greater than `--num-send-instructions-per-tx * --tx-batch-size`.

```shell
args=(
  -u "$URL"
  read-accounts-run
  --accounts-file accounts.json
  --duration 30
  --tx-batch-size 64
  --num-conflict-groups 4
  --num-send-instructions-per-tx 1
  --transfer-tx-cu-budget 600
  --send-fanout 2
  ws-leader-tracker
)
solana-transaction-bench "${args[@]}"
```

#### Forcing Transaction Expiry (queue-discard stress test)

Use `--blockhash-stale-slots` to sign transactions with a deliberately aged blockhash instead of
the freshest one. By default the tool uses the latest blockhash, so transactions carry the full
validity window (the validator rejects a transaction once its blockhash is more than 150 blocks
old) and effectively never expire while queued. With a non-zero value, the blockhash updater
fetches — via `getBlock` — the blockhash of a block that many slots behind the tip, and re-fetches
each tick so the signed blockhash stays a constant number of blocks old as the chain advances.

The staleness is expressed in **slots (blocks)** rather than seconds on purpose: the validator's
limit is 150 blocks, not a wall-clock duration, and block time is rarely exactly 400ms on a single
validator (especially under load). It is also applied immediately — there is no wall-clock warmup.

This stresses the validator's discard-on-age path. A leader buffers incoming transactions before
its leader slot; if their blockhash is close to expiry, they expire while sitting in the scheduler
queue and must be discarded instead of executed.

Pick a value just under 150 (e.g. `145`). Larger values leave fewer blocks of validity, so buffered
transactions expire sooner, but a value `>= 150` makes them arrive already-expired and get dropped
at ingestion (never queued) instead. Tune empirically against the validator's banking-stage
scheduler metrics:

* `num_dropped_on_clean` increasing — transactions were buffered and then discarded on age. This is
  the behavior you want to maximize.
* `num_dropped_on_receive_age` increasing — transactions were already expired on arrival and
  dropped at ingestion. Lower `--blockhash-stale-slots` if this dominates.
* transactions executing normally — the blockhash is still too fresh; raise the value.

Use plenty of payers and a high send rate so the queue stays deep. This `getBlock` mode needs the
RPC to serve `getBlock`, which on agave requires `--enable-rpc-transaction-history` — and that flag
can itself slow the validator under load (RocksDB write amplification), skewing the test. If you
can't enable it, use the seconds-based delay line instead:

**`--blockhash-stale-secs`** — sign with a blockhash this many *seconds* old, derived purely from
`getLatestBlockhash` (no `getBlock`, no `--enable-rpc-transaction-history`). The tool observes the
blockhash stream and **primes for that many seconds before it starts sending**, so every
transaction is uniformly aged from the first one (no warmup ramp) and the `--duration` clock starts
after priming. Set it just under the validity window — `150 blocks × slot_time` (e.g. ~22s at
~150ms slots, ~60s at 400ms). Mutually exclusive with `--blockhash-stale-slots`. Same tuning
metrics apply (`num_dropped_on_clean` good, `num_dropped_on_receive_age` too stale). Prefer this on
a single local validator; use `--blockhash-stale-slots` (exact block count) when a separate
history-serving RPC is available.

```shell
args=(
  -u "$URL"
  read-accounts-run
  --accounts-file accounts.json
  --duration 120
  --blockhash-stale-slots 145
  --target-tps 50000
  --staked-identity-file "$VALIDATOR_IDENTITY"
  --send-fanout 1
  ws-leader-tracker
)
solana-transaction-bench "${args[@]}"
```

#### Use yellowstone-grpc

Use `yellowstone-leader-tracker` when you want to receive slot updates from a Yellowstone gRPC
endpoint instead of the RPC websocket. The Yellowstone URL is a gRPC endpoint, and the token is
passed as the second positional argument.

```shell
args=(
  -u "$URL"
  --authority "$FUNDER_KEYPAIR"
  read-accounts-run
  --accounts-file accounts.json
  --duration 30
  --staked-identity-file "$VALIDATOR_IDENTITY"
  --send-fanout 1
  yellowstone-leader-tracker "$YELLOWSTONE_GRPC_URL" "$YELLOWSTONE_GRPC_TOKEN"
)
solana-transaction-bench "${args[@]}"
```
